Notes for distribution:

.DWG external reference files:
External reference (xref) paths may be present.  Make sure these paths work or that the root drawing is using the correct references.
eTransmit does not include files required by xrefs unless they are also required by the root drawing.  In particular, plot style tables and overlay xrefs that are not used by the root drawing are omitted

Raster image files:
Paths may be present on references to raster images.  Make sure these paths work or that the root drawing is using the correct references.

.SHX fonts:
Please copy these fonts to the AutoCAD Fonts directory and check with the font manufacturer about distribution rights.  Fonts supplied with AutoCAD are freely distributable.

.TTF fonts:
TTF fonts must be registered with the Operating System.  To register, copy these files to the system fonts folder or use the fonts application in the Control Panel.  Check with the font manufacturer about distribution rights.  Fonts supplied with AutoCAD are freely distributable.

.PC3 printer configuration files:
Please copy these files to the AutoCAD Printer Configuration Search Path directory.

.CTB/.STB plot style tables:
Please copy these files to the AutoCAD Plot Style Table Search Path directory.

Material texture files:
Please copy these files to the AutoCAD Texture Maps Search Path directory.

The AutoCAD variable FONTALT was set to:
C:\Users\kadjorlolo.EHKA2011\appdata\roaming\autodesk\mep 2014\enu\support\simplex.shx
Please make sure that the FONTALT variable is set to this file or an equivalent before opening any drawings.  All text styles with missing fonts are automatically set to this font.
